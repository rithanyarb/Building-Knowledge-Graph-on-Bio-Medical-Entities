## What is a Knowledge Graph?
A Knowledge graph, also known as a semantic network, represents a network of real-world entities—i.e. objects, events or concepts—and illustrates the relationship between them.

### Using Neo4j
Neo4j is used to represent data in a graphical model.

***This project shows the  relationships between "Diseases, Medicines, and Dosages."***
